// ðŸš¨ SECURITY: This struct is sent to all users regardless of whether or
// not they are logged in, for example on an auth.public=false private
// server. Including secret fields here is OK if it is based on the user's
// authentication above, but do not include e.g. hard-coded secrets about
// the server instance here as they would be sent to anonymous users.
